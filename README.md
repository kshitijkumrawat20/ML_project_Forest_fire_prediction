# FOREST FIRE PREDICTIONðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## ABOUT THE PROJECTðŸ”Ž

- Objective: Predict the Forest Weather Index (FWI) for forest fire risk assessment using meteorological parameters like temperature, rainfall, ISI, wind speed, etc.
- Data: Trained on the Algerian Forest Fire dataset containing historical weather conditions and forest fire incidents.
- Approach: Explored and engineered relevant features, trained various regression models (Simple, Lasso, Ridge) on the data, with Ridge Regression providing the best predictive performance.
- Deployment: Deployed the trained Ridge Regression model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with a CodePipeline set up between the GitHub repository and Elastic Beanstalk for continuous integration and deployment.
- Applications: Enable real-time FWI prediction by inputting current weather conditions, aiding fire prevention strategies, resource allocation, public safety warnings, and informed decision-making.
- User Interface: Developed a user-friendly application or dashboard for seamless interaction with the deployed model.
